## What I'm Up To

> ✨ Currently Head of Engineering on the founding team at Scroobious, so you're most likely to find me there building tech to increase diversity in the startup ecosystem and promote equity in the fundraising experience. Our team fosters an incredibly diverse community, connecting early-stage founders, investors, and partners, to break down the barriers that have historically prevented underrepresented founders from accessing the necessary capital to grow their businesses and thrive.
